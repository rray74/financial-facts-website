        Financial Facts is a reference site. You don't need an account, and it doesn't ask you for
        any personal information.

    <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Cookies</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">
        The public site doesn't set any cookies, and there is no advertising or tracking.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Server logs</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">
        Like almost every website, the servers that host Financial Facts automatically record
        technical information about each visit, such as your IP address, browser type and the pages
        requested. This is used only to keep the site running securely and is not used to identify
        you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Fonts</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">
        The site's fonts are loaded from Google Fonts, which means your browser connects to Google's
        servers and shares your IP address with Google when a page loads. See Google's privacy policy
        for how it handles this.
