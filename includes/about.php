    <h1 class="font-display text-4xl font-semibold mb-6">About Financial Facts</h1>

    <p class="text-lg opacity-80 mb-8">
        Financial Facts is a reference site for the figures that matter in UK personal finance:
        tax rates and allowances, pension limits, benefit rates, savings allowances and more.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What makes it different</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Every figure on the site is a single, dated fact taken from an official source such as
        GOV.UK, HMRC, the Scottish and Welsh governments or NS&amp;I. Each one links to where it came
        from and shows when it was last checked, so you can always see how current it is and
        confirm it yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        When a figure changes, it's updated once and the change appears everywhere that figure is
        used, including the worked examples. The site keeps a record of every change, so each page
        shows what has changed and when.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">

        for the full detail of how sources are chosen and figures kept up to date.

    <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Independent and advert-free</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">
        The site isn't paid to feature any provider or product, and figures are chosen because they
        are useful, not because anyone is selling something.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Information, not advice</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">
        Financial Facts explains the rules and figures but can't tell you what to do in your own
        situation. See the <a href="/disclaimer/" class="underline hover:text-accent">disclaimer</a>
        for more.
